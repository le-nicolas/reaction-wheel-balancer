# Archive

This directory stores historical artifacts that are not part of the active runtime stack.

## Layout

- `archive/legacy/scripts/`: early prototype controllers and experiments.
- `archive/legacy/models/`: MuJoCo XML models used by legacy scripts.
- `archive/logs/`: historical run logs moved out of the repository root.
- `archive/text_outputs/`: older plain-text outputs and diagnostics.

## Notes

- Active development targets `final/`.
- Legacy files are kept for traceability and comparison, not as maintained entry points.
