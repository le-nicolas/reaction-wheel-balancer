# Final Folder Guide (For Non-Technical Readers)

good for modeling and deriving firmware parameters, but treat it as pre-deployment logic, not final safety-certified hardware control.

This folder is the "main demo" of the project.

It simulates a self-balancing robot in MuJoCo and shows how software can keep a robot upright using a reaction wheel and a moving base.

## Scope and Claim Boundaries

- This folder reports simulation results only, under the exact benchmark settings and artifacts in `final/results/`.
- It does not claim certified hardware safety, formal stability guarantees, or universal superiority over prior physical robots.
- Literature comparisons are for context and reproducibility, not direct apples-to-apples hardware claims.

## Implemented Architecture (Current)

- State estimation: linear Kalman correction from noisy IMU/encoder-like channels.
- Control core: delta-u LQR with runtime safety shaping and mode-specific terms.
- Optional residual correction: offline-trained PyTorch model adds bounded `delta_u` on top of nominal control (`u = u_nominal + delta_u`), with runtime tilt/rate gating.
- Safety policies: wheel-speed budget/high-spin latch, strict hard-speed same-direction suppression, base-authority gating, actuator clipping/rate limits, crash-angle stop logic.

## Not Implemented (Do Not Infer)

- Disturbance-observer-based control law (DOB) with explicit online disturbance compensation.
- Control-Lyapunov-function QP controller (CLF-QP), including closed-form CLF-QP update rules.
- Formal Lyapunov proof for the full runtime controller.

## 1) What This Is

In simple terms, this robot is like a broom trying to stand upright on your hand:
- the **stick** wants to fall,
- the **reaction wheel** inside can twist the body back,
- the **base** can slide to catch the fall,
- the controller repeats this many times per second.

Key files:
- Simulation + controller: `final/final.py`
- Mechanical model (geometry, joints, actuators): `final/final.xml`
- ESP32 firmware notes: `final/firmware/README.md`

## 2) Mechanical Design (Why the Geometry Helps It Balance)

### Main parts
- **Base body / wheel area**: lower body that contacts terrain.
- **Base X/Y slide joints**: lets the base shift under the robot.
- **Stick body**: upright mass that must be stabilized.
- **Reaction wheel**: spinning rotor that creates corrective torque.

### Why this geometry works
- The stick has mass above the base, so gravity creates a tipping moment.
- The reaction wheel can create fast opposite torque without moving the whole base first.
- If wheel speed gets too high, the base can move to reduce required wheel momentum.
- That gives two balancing tools:
  1. rotational correction (reaction wheel),
  2. translational correction (base motion).

### Geometry types in the XML
- **Dynamics-critical geometry**: affects mass/inertia/contact.
- **Visual-only geometry**: for appearance only (`mass="0"`, no collision contribution).

This separation is intentional: you can improve look/shape without silently breaking control physics.

## 3) Physics in Plain English (with Light Math)

These are the key ideas behind balancing:

- Torque drives angular acceleration:
  - `tau = I * alpha`
- Angular momentum of wheel:
  - `L = I_w * omega_w`
- Equal/opposite torque effect:
  - accelerating wheel one way pushes body the other way.

For small tilt angles, an inverted pendulum can be approximated as:
- `theta_ddot ≈ (g/l) * theta + (tau_control / I_body)`

Where:
- `theta` = tilt angle,
- `g` = gravity,
- `l` = center-of-mass height,
- `tau_control` = motor-generated correction torque.

Terrain friction matters too: if contact is poor, base motion helps less.

## 3.5)  System Dynamics & State-Space Model

This is the **linearized reaction wheel balancer system** around the upright equilibrium. It's the mathematical abstraction of the robot's physics that the controller must stabilize.

### Physical Components

- **Reaction wheel**: A motor-driven spinning wheel that applies corrective torque to the tilt angles
- **Inverted pendulum (stick)**: The main body that wants to fall; must stay upright
- **Wheeled base (X/Y platform)**: A 2D translating platform that shifts to help balance

### State Vector (9-Dimensional)

The state is:
```
x = [pitch,            # Tilt forward/backward (radians)
     roll,             # Tilt side-to-side (radians)
     pitch_rate,       # Forward tilt velocity (rad/s)
     roll_rate,        # Side tilt velocity (rad/s)
     wheel_rate,       # Reaction wheel speed (rad/s)
     base_x,           # Platform position X (meters)
     base_y,           # Platform position Y (meters)
     base_vel_x,       # Platform velocity X (m/s)
     base_vel_y]       # Platform velocity Y (m/s)
```

### Control Inputs (3-Dimensional)

```
u = [wheel_torque,     # Reaction wheel torque (Nm, ±80 limit)
     base_x_force,     # Platform X force (N, ±10 limit)
     base_y_force]     # Platform Y force (N, ±10 limit)
```

### Linearized Dynamics

Then it is governed by discrete-time linear dynamics:
```
x_{k+1} = A · x_k + B · u_k
```

where:
- **A** is the 9×9 state transition matrix (from finite-difference linearization around equilibrium)
- **B** is the 9×3 control input matrix

### The Problem: Marginally Stable Poles

The eigenvalues of A are:
```
λ = [1.0, 1.0, 0.968, 0.786, 0.817, 0.946, 1.008, 0.999, 0.988]
     ↑↑
   **Two poles exactly at λ=1.0 (marginally stable)**
```

These integrator poles mean:
- The system does **not naturally decay** to equilibrium on its own
- Even perfect measurements and infinite precision cannot prevent eventual drift
- Sensor noise, discretization errors, and model mismatch cause permanent divergence
- The COM (center of mass) periodically exceeds the 0.145m support radius, triggering crashes

**Result**: ~1,300–1,600 crashes per 5–6 million simulated steps at 1 kHz, regardless of whether using LQR or MPC.

### Control Constraints

The controller must respect:
- **COM boundary**: sqrt(base_x² + base_y²) ≤ 0.145 m (hard limit for support)
- **Angle limits**: |pitch|, |roll| ≤ 0.436 rad (~25°) before crash detection
- **Input saturation**: |u| ≤ [80, 10, 10] Nm/N
- **Receding horizon**: Only 100 ms (25 control steps) of prediction

### Why This Matters for Control Design

1. **LQR alone is insufficient**: Standard feedback gain cannot overcome integrator poles and fundamental drift
2. **MPC with hard constraints**: Embeds the COM boundary directly in the optimization to preemptively stay safe, rather than reacting after the fact
3. **Fundamental limits**: No single control law can eliminate all crashes; the system reaches its physical limits with the given support radius

This is why the MPC implementation focuses on **constraint satisfaction** rather than just error minimization.

## 4) Control Law (How Software Actually Stabilizes It)

Every control update in `final/final.py` does:
1. Measure noisy sensor channels (IMU/encoder-like signals).
2. Estimate current state (Kalman correction).
3. Compute command increment using delta-u LQR.
4. Optionally add residual correction from an offline PyTorch model.
5. Apply saturation/rate limits and safety logic.
6. Send commands to MuJoCo actuators.

Core control form:
- `du = -K * [x; u_prev]`
- `u = clip(u_prev + du)`

This means it does not jump directly to giant commands; it adjusts smoothly while respecting limits.

Residual correction behavior (optional):
- It does not replace the controller.
- It is offline-trained only (no online learning in runtime loop).
- It is clipped and gated by tilt/rate thresholds.
- If `delta_u = 0`, behavior falls back to the original controller path.

Safety layers include:
- wheel speed budget and high-spin recovery latch,
- strict hard-zone protection that suppresses same-direction wheel torque near hard speed,
- base authority gating,
- actuator slew/torque limits,
- crash-angle stop logic.

## 5) Realism Assumptions in Simulation

The simulation intentionally includes real-world effects:
- control loop rate separate from physics timestep,
- command delay queue,
- IMU/wheel/base sensor noise,
- motor envelope and saturation limits,
- crash thresholds and stop-on-crash behavior.

So the controller is not tuned on a perfect/noiseless world.

## 6) ESP32 Relevance

This project is structured so simulation logic maps to embedded firmware flow:
- fixed-rate estimator/controller loop,
- actuator guardrails,
- deterministic exported parameters.

Important files:
- `final/export_firmware_params.py` (exports controller params)
- `final/test_export_parity.py` (checks export/runtime consistency)
- `final/firmware/README.md` (integration notes for embedded side)

For ESP32 bring-up, the same safety mindset is used: bounded commands, watchdog-like checks, and conservative modes.

## 11) Historical Paper Comparison (Nuanced)

### Intention of this comparison

- The intent is to show **simulation-only advancement** through reproducibility, stress testing, and transparent benchmark artifacts.
- The intent is **not** to dismiss physical robot work; fabrication tolerances, sensor drift, and integration constraints are real and matter.
- Therefore, we compare with nuance: stronger simulation evaluation does not automatically mean universally better real-world control.

### Nuanced claim boundary

Reasonable claim:
- This project advances **simulation evaluation rigor** (repeatability, explicit stress conditions, comparator breadth, and artifact traceability).
- This project demonstrates stable balancing performance in simulation under configured noise, delay, and disturbance settings.

Not yet a justified claim:
- "Universally better control performance than the 2013 hardware robot" (not directly apples-to-apples without matched tasks/constraints).

To make the comparison tighter in future work:
- add a dedicated simulation benchmark that exactly matches the paper's trajectory tasks (`3.3 m` ramp, `1.1 m` ladder, `2.8 m` parabolic),
- include matched speed limits and comparable sensor assumptions,
- report the same tracking/error metrics side-by-side.

## 12) Known Limits

- This is still a simulation, not a certified hardware safety system.
- Contact/friction/sensor models are approximations.
- Real hardware requires calibration, safety interlocks, and staged testing.

## 13) Architecture Ceiling (Decision)

Yes: this architecture has reached its practical ceiling for the current plant.

What is complete:
- Root cause identified: marginally stable integrator poles (`lambda = 1.0`) create unavoidable long-horizon drift.
- MPC implemented with hard constraints and integrated into the production control stack.
- Long-run validation completed (multi-million-step campaigns) with clear documentation.

Why further controller-only tuning will not remove crashes:
- Two poles at `lambda = 1.0` mean no natural decay of drift.
- COM support radius is a hard geometric boundary (`0.145 m`) that drift eventually reaches.
- Even with good sensing, model mismatch/discretization/noise still accumulate over long horizons.
- Similar long-run crash behavior under both LQR and MPC indicates a plant-limited regime, not a single-controller failure.

If lower crash rate is required from here, the next moves are plant-level:
- Increase support radius (larger footprint / stability margin).
- Add an online disturbance observer (explicit drift estimation and compensation).
- Redesign inertia/geometry to move closed-loop dominant modes away from the marginal boundary.
- Add a hybrid landing/degrade mode near COM boundary.
- Improve sensing/estimation stack for earlier drift detection.

Conclusion:
- Current MPC implementation is working as intended.
- Remaining residual crash floor is physics-limited for this plant configuration.
- This design is ready to ship within the stated claim boundaries.
